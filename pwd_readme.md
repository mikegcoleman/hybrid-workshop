# Deploying Multi-OS applications with Docker EE

## (Play With Docker Version)

Docker EE 17.06 is the first Containers-as-a-Service platform to offer production-level support for the integrated management and security of Linux AND Windows Server Containers.

In this lab we'll use a Docker EE cluster comprised of Windows and Linux nodes. We'll deploy both a Linux and Windows web app, as well as a multi-service application that includes both Windows and Linux components. We will then look at scaling up your web app, as well how Docker EE handles system interruptions and upgrades.

## Understanding the Play With Docker Interface

![](./images/pwd_screen.png)

There are three main components to the Play With Docker (PWD) interface

### 1. Console Access
Play with Docker provides access to the 3 Docker EE hosts in your Cluster. These machines are:

* A Linux-based Docker EE 17.06 Manager node
* A Linux-based Docker EE 17.06 Worker node
* A Windows Server 2016-based Docker EE 17.06 Worker Node

By clicking a name on the left, the console window will be connected to that node

### 2. Access to your Universal Control Plane (UCP) and Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) servers

Additionally, the PWD screen provides you one-click access to the Universal Control Plane (UCP)
web-based management interface as well as the Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) web-based management interface. Click on either the `UCP` or `DTR` button will bring up the respective server web interface in a new tab. 

### 3. Session Information

Throughout the lab you will be asked to provide either hosntnames or login credentials that are unique to your environment. These are displayed for you at the top of the screen. 

## Document conventions

- When you encounter a phrase in between `<` and `>`  you are meant to substitute in a different value.

	For instance if you see `<dtr domain>` you would actually type something like `ip172-18-0-7-b70lttfic4qg008cvm90.direct.microsoft.play-with-docker.com`

- When you see the Linux penguin all the following instructions should be completed in your Linux console

	![](./images/linux75.png)

- When you see the Windows flag all the subsequent instructions should be completed in your Windows cosnsole.

## <a name="task1"></a>Task 1: Configure the Docker EE Cluster

The Play with Docker (PWD) environment is almost completely setup, but before we can begin the labs we need to do two more steps. First we'll add a Windows node to the cluster, and then we'll crea

### <a name="task 1.1"></a>Task 1.1: Accessing PWD

1. Navigate in your web browswer to [http://ee.microsoft.play-with-docker.com](http://ee.microsoft.play-with-docker.com)

2. At the login in screen provide your email and click `Access`

	It will take about 5 minutes to provision out your PWD environment. After this step completes, you'll be ready to move on to step 1.2: Installing a Windows worker node

### <a name="task1.2"></a>Task 1.2: Install a Windows worker node



Let's start by adding our 3rd node to the cluster, a Windows Server 2016 worker node. 

1. From the main PWD screen click the `UCP` button on the left side of the screen

	> **Note**: Because this is a lab-based install of Docker EE we are using the default self-signed certs. Because of this your browser may display a security warning. It is safe to click through this warning. 
	> 
	> In a production environment you would use certs from a trusted certificate authority and would not see this screen.
	> ![](./images/ssl_error.png)

2. When prompted enter your username and password (these can be found at the top of your main PWD screen). The UCP web interface should load up in your web browser. 

	> **Note**: There is a warning displayed at the top of the screen, this is an artifact of running in a lab environment. A UCP server configured for a production environment would not display this warning


3. From the main dashboard screen, click `Add a Node` on the bottom left of the screen
	
	![](./images/add_a_node.png)

	> **Note**: You may notice that there is a UI component to select `Linux` or `Windows`on the `Add Node` screen. In a production environment where you are starting from scratch there are [a few prerequisite steps] to adding a Windows node. However, we've already done these steps in the PWD envrionemnt. So for this lab, just leave the selecton on `Linux` and move on to step 2

4. Copy the text from the dark box shown on the `Add Node` screen.

	> **Note** There is an icon in the upper right corner of the box that you can click to copy the text to your clipboard

	![](./images/join_text.png)

	![](./images/windows75.png)

6. Switch back to the PWD interface, and click the name of your Windows node. This will connect the web-based console to your Windows Server 2016 Docker EE host. 

7. Paste the text from Step 4 at the command prompt in the Windows console. 

	You should see the message `This node joined a swarm as a worker.` indicating you've successfully joined the node to the cluster.

5. Switch back to the UCP server in your web browser and click the `x` in the upper right corner to close the `Add Node` window

6. You should be taken to the `Nodes` screen will will see 3 nodes listed at the bottom of your screen. 

	After a minute or two refresh your web browswer to ensure that your Windows worker node has come up as `healthy`
	
	![](./images/node_listing.png)

Congratulations on adding a Windows node to your UCP cluster. Next up we'll create a couple of repositories in Docker Trusted registry.

### <a name="task1.3"></a>Task 1.3: Create Two DTR Repositories

Docker Trusted Registry is a special server designed to store and manage your Docker images. In this lab we're going to create a couple of different Docker images, and push them to DTR. But before we can do that we need to setup respositories in which those images will reside. 

1. In the PWD web interface click the `DTR` button on the left side of the scree.

	> **Note**: As with UCP before, DTR is also using self-signed certs. It's safe to click through any browser warning you might encoutner. 

2. From the main DTR page click `New Repository`. This brings up the new repository dialog

	![](./images/create_repository.png)

3. Under `REPOSITORY NAME` type `linux_tweet_app`. Leave the rest of the values the same, and click `Save`

	Let's repeat this process to create a repository for our Windows tweet app. 

4. Once again, click the green `New repository` button.

5. Under `REPOSITORY NAME` type `windows_tweet_app`. Leave the rest of the values the same, and click `Save`


	![](./images/two_repos.png)

Congratulations you have created two new repositories.

## <a name="task2"></a>Task 2: Deploy a Linux Web App

Now that we've completely configured our cluster, let's deploy a couple of web apps. These are simple web pages that allow you to send a tweet. One is built on Linux using NGINX and the other is build on Windows Server 2016 using IIS.  

Let's start with the Linux version.

### <a name="task2.1"></a> Task 2.1: Clone the Demo Repo

![](./images/linux75.png)

1. From PWD click on on the `worker1` link on the left to connnect your web console to the UCP Linux worker node. 

2. Use git to clone the workshop repository.

	```
	$ git clone https://github.com/mikegcoleman/hybrid-workshop.git
	```

	You should see something like this as the output:

	```
	Cloning into 'hybrid-workshop'...
	remote: Counting objects: 13, done.
	remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
	remote: Total 13 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
	Unpacking objects: 100% (13/13), done.
	Checking connectivity... done.
	```

	You now have the necessary demo code on your Linux VM.

### <a name="task2.2"></a> Task 2.2: Build and Push the Linux Web App Image

![](./images/linux75.png)

1. Change into the `linux_tweet_app` directory.

	`$ cd ./hybrid-workshop/linux_tweet_app/`

2. Use `docker image build` to build your Linux tweet web app Docker image.

	`$ docker image build -t <dtr host name>/<your user name>/linux_tweet_app .`
	
	> **Note**: Be sure to substitute your DTR Host Name and your User Name - both these are listed at the top of your PWD page.

	The `-t` tells Docker that you're going to store this image in the your repo on the Docker Trusted Registry server

	> **Note**: Feel free to examine the Dockerfile in this directory if you'd like to see how the image is being built.

	Your output should be similar to what is shown below

	```
	Sending build context to Docker daemon  4.096kB
	Step 1/4 : FROM nginx:latest
	latest: Pulling from library/nginx

	Successfully built ed5f550fc339
	Successfully tagged  <dtr host name>/<your user name>/linux_tweet_app:latest
	```

3. Log into your DTR server from the command line

	```
	$ docker login <dtr host name>
	Username: <your username>
	Password: <your password>
	Login Succeeded
	```
4. Use `docker image push` to upload your image up to Docker Trusted Registry.

	> **Note**: You should still be logged into DTR from the previous steps, but if not you will need to log in again.

	```
	$ docker image push <dtr host name>/<your user name>/linux_tweet_app
	```

	The output should be similar to the following:

	```
	The push refers to a repository [<dtr host name>/<your user name>/linux_tweet_app]
	feecabd76a78: Pushed
	3c749ee6d1f5: Pushed
	af5bd3938f60: Pushed

	```

4. In your web browser head back to your DTR server and click `View Details` next to your `linux_tweet_app` repo to see the details of the repo.

	> **Note**: If you've closed the tab with your DTR server, just click the `DTR` button from the PWD page. 

5. Click on `Images` from the horizontal menu. Notice that your newly pushed image is now on your DTR.

### <a name="task2.3"></a> Task 2.3: Deploy the Web App using UCP

Now let's run our application by by creating a new service.

Services are application building blocks (although in many cases an application will only have one service, such as this example). Services are based on a single Docker image. When you create a new service you instantiate at least one container automatically, but you can scale the number up (or down) to meet the needs of your service.

1. Switch back to your UCP server in your web broswer

	> **Note**: If you've closed your UCP tab, you can simply click `UCP` from the PWD page to relaunch the UCP web interface
	
2. In the left hand menu click `Services`

3. In the upper right corner click `Create Service`

4. Enter `linux_tweet_app` for the name.

4. Under `Image` enter the path to your image which should be `<dtr host name>/<your user name>/linux_tweet_app`

5. From the left hand menu click `Scheduling`

8. From the left hand menu click `Network`

9. Click `Publish Port+`

	We need to open a port for our web server. Since port 80 is already used by UCP on one node, and DTR on the other, we'll need to pick an alternate port. We'll go with 8088.

10. Fill out the port fields as shown below

	![](./images/linux_ports.png)

11. Click `Confirm`

12. Click `Create` near the bottom right of the screen.

After a few seconds you should see a green dot next to your service name. Once you see you green dot you can  point your web browser to `http://<UCP Host Name>:8088` to see your running website  (it may take a minute or so after the dot turns green for the service to be fully available). 

> **Note**: You want to go to `http://` not `https://`

###Extra Credit: Ingress Load Balancing

1. In UCP click on `Services` in the left hand menu. 

2. From the List of services click on `linux_tweet_app`

3. From the dropdown on the right-hand side select `Inspect` and then `Containers` Notice which host the container is running on. Is it running on the manager or the worker node?

	If it's the worker node, how did your web browser find it when we pointed at the UCP Manager node?
	
4. Point your browser at `http://<DTR Host Name>:8088`. Did the site come up? In the end it doesn't matter if we try and access the service via the manager or the worker, Docker EE will route the request correctly.

	> **Note**: DTR is running on the worker node, so pointing to the DTR server is the same as pointing at the worker node. 
	
This is an example of the built in ingress load balancer in Docker EE. Regardless of where a Linux-based service is actually running, you can access it from any Linux node in the cluster. So, if it's running on the manager in our cluster, you can still get to it by accessing the worker node. Docker EE can accept the request coming into any of the Linux nodes in the cluster, and route it to a host that's actually running a container for that service. 


## <a name="task3"></a>Task 3: Deploy a Windows Web App

Now we'll deploy the Windows version of the tweet app.

### <a name="task3.1"></a> Task 3.1: Create the dockerfile with Image2Docker

There is a Windows Server 2016 VHD that contains our Windows Tweet App stored in `c:\` on Windows host. We're going to use Image2Docker to scan the VHD, and create a Dockerfile. We'll build the Dockerfile as we did in the previous step, push it to DTR, and then deploy our Windows tweet app.

![](./images/windows75.png)

1. Click the name of your Windows host in PWD to switch your web console.
2
2. Use the [Image2Docker](https://github.com/docker/communitytools-image2docker-win) `ConvertTo-Dockerfile` command to create a dockerfile from the VHD.

	Copy and paste the command below into your Windows console window.

	```
	ConvertTo-Dockerfile -ImagePath c:\ws2016.vhd `
	                     -Artifact IIS `
	                     -OutputPath C:\windowstweetapp `
	                     -Verbose
	```

	As mentioned before Image2Docker will scan the VHD, and extract out a Dockerfile based on the contents of the VHD. The list below explains the command line aruguments. 

	* `ImagePath` specifies where the VHD can be found

	* `Artifact` specifies what feature or code to look for

	* `OutputPath` specifies where to write the dockerfile and other items

	* `Verbose` instructs the script to provide extra output.

When the process completes you'll find a dockerfile in `c:\windowstweetapp`


### <a name="task3.2"></a> Task 3.2: Build and Push Your Image to Docker Trusted Registry

![](./images/windows75.png)

1. CD into the `c:\windowstweetapp` directory (this is where your Image2Docker files have been placed).

	`PS C:\> cd c:\windowstweetapp\`


2. Use `docker image build` to build your Windows tweet web app Docker image.

	`$ docker image build -t <dtr host name>/<your user name>/windows_tweet_app .`

	> **Note**: Feel free to examine the Dockerfile in this directory if you'd like to see how the image is being built.

	Your output should be similar to what is shown below

	```
	PS C:\windowstweetapp> docker build -t <dtr host name>/<your user name>/windows_tweet_app .

	Sending build context to Docker daemon  6.144kB

	```
	> **Note**: It will take sevearl minutes for your image to build. 

4. Log into Docker Trusted Registry

	```
	PS C:\> docker login <dtr host name>
	Username: <your username>
	Password: <your password>
	Login Succeeded
	```

5. Push your new image up to Docker Trusted Registry.

	```
	PS C:\Users\docker> docker image push <dtr hostname>/<your username>/windows_tweet_app
	The push refers to a repository [<dtr hostname>/<your username>/windows_tweet_app]

	```

### <a name="task3.3"></a> Task 3.3: Deploy the Windows Web App
Now that we have our Windows Tweet App up on the DTR server, let's deploy it. It's going to be almost identical to how did the Linux version with a couple of one small exceptionn: Docker EE on Windows Server 2016 does not currently support ingress load balancing, so we'll exposer the ports in `host` mode using `dnsrr`

1. Switch back to UCP in your web browser

2. In the left hand menu click `Services`

3. In the upper right corner click `Create Service`

4. Enter `windows_tweet_app` for the name.

4. Under `Image` enter the path to your image which should be `<dtr hostname>/<your username>/windows_tweet_app`

8. From the left hand menu click `Network`

8. Set the `ENDPOINT SPEC` to `DNS Round Robin`. This tells the service to load balance using DNS. The alternative is VIP, which uses IPVS.

9. Click `Publish Port+`

	We need to open a port for our web server. This app runs on port 80 which is used by DTR so let's use 8082.

10. Fill out the port fields as shown below. **Be sure to set the `Publish Mode` to  `Host`**

	![](./images/windows_ports.png)

11. Click 'Confirm'

12. Click `Create` near the bottom right of the screen.

After a few seconds you should see a green dot next to your service name. Once you see you green dot you can  point your web browser to `http://<windows host>:8082` to see your running website.

## <a name="task4"></a> Deploying a Multi-OS Application

For our last exercise we'll use a docker compose file to deploy an application that uses a Java front end designed to be deployed on Linux, with a Microsoft SQL Server back end running on windows.

### <a name="task4.1"></a> Task 4.1: Examine the Docker Compose file

We'll use a Docker Compose file to instantiate our application. With this file we can define all our services and their parameters, as well as other Docker primatives such as networks.

Let's look at the Docker Compose file:

```
version: "3.2"

services:

  database:
    image: sixeyed/atsea-db:mssql
    ports:
      - mode: host
        target: 1433
    networks:
     - atsea
    deploy:
      endpoint_mode: dnsrr
      placement:
        constraints:
          - 'node.platform.os == windows'

  appserver:
    image: sixeyed/atsea-app:mssql
    ports:
      - target: 8080
        published: 8080
    networks:
      - atsea
    deploy:
      placement:
        constraints:
          - 'node.platform.os == linux'

networks:
  atsea:
```

There are two services. `appserver` is our web frontend written in Java, and `database` is our Microsoft SQL Server database. The rest of the commands should look familiar as they are very close to what we used when we deployed our tweet services manually.

One thing that is new is the creation of an overlay network (`atsea`). Overlay networks allow containers running on different hosts to communicate over a private software-defined network. In this case, the web frontend on our Linux host will use the `atsea` network to communicate with the database.

You may have used Docker Compose before to deploy multi-service applications, but with swarm we use a slightly different command: `docker stack`.

### <a name="task4.2"></a> Task 4.2: Deploy the Application

1. Move to the UCP console in your web browser

2. In the left hand menu click `stacks`

3. In the upper right click `Create Stack`

4. Enter `atsea` under `NAME`

5. Select `Services` under `MODE`

6. Select `SHOW VERBOSE COMPOSE OUTPUT`

7. Paste the compose file from above into the `COMPOSE.YML` box

8.  Click `Create`

	You will see some output to show the progress of your deployment, and then a banner will pop up at the bottom indicating your deployment was successful.

9. Click `Done`

The UI shows your stack (`atsea`) and that it's comprised of 2 services and 1 network.

1. Click on the `atsea` stack in the list

2. From the right side of the screen choose `Services` under `Inspect Resource`

	![](./images/inspect_resoource.png)

	Here you can see your two services running. It may take a few minutes for the databased service to come up (the dot to turn green). Once it does move on to the next section.


### <a name="task4.3"></a> Task 4.3: Verify the Running Application

1. To see our running web site (an art store) visit `http://<UCP host name>:8080>`

	The thumbnails you see displayed are actually pulled from the SQL database. This is how you know that the connection is working between the database and web front end.


This concludes our workshop, thanks for attending.
